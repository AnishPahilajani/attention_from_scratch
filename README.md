# Nano GPT

I am attempting to re create Andrej Karpathy's Nano GPT from scratch. In this process I have learnt how to implement Self Attention and Multi Head Attention from scratch. 

## Conda Environment

To set up the project environment, you can create a Conda environment using the provided YAML file:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Activate the Environment

```shell
conda activate nano_gpt
```
